                                          because they arrive on legal immigrant visas, most will be able to draw a wide
                                         range of taxpayer-funded benefits, and corporations will be allowed to directly
                                         substitute these workers for Americans.
                                         Improved border security would have no effect on the continued arrival of

P(1)0000064.pdf,459,"The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan,
                                         announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on
                                         October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall. Organizers of the
                                          Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks,
                                          Latinos and incarcerated.
                                         They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
                                         radical groups. Only black activists say ""black lives matter"", forgetting the fact
                                         that justice is when all lives matter.
                                         Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
                                         law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
                                         over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
                                         immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
                                          be imprisoned.
                                         Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
                                         Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's
                                          benevolent intentions.
                                         This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
                                         communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
                                         news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
                                          Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
                                         American extremists to execute him.
                                         There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he
                                         should live here legally; he should not break the law.

P(1)0000076.pdf,470,"America has always been hinged on hard-working people. If you remove jobs,
                                          you'll remove our country from the world map. The state of Pennsylvania
                                         rose owing to multiple enterprises mining coal, producing steel, and creating
                                         the need for other jobs, groceries, doctors, dentists, insurance, gas, vehicles,
                                          mechanics and the list goes on. As far as Mr. Trump pursues the goal of
                                         creating more jobs and supports the working class. He said he would put
                                          miners back to work. We could help Mr. Trump win Pennsylvania which is a
                                          battleground state. We'd like to organize a rally ""Miners for Trump"" in
                                         Pennsylvania.
                                          Have something against coal industries? Please note then that burning coal is
                                         not more harmful than lumber. Alternative energy is only possible when
                                         subsidized by government for it is not lucrative. You cannot leave tens of
                                         thousands of people without a job just because of lobbyists' interests.
                                         The current list of locations is being elaborated. Suggested cities are Erie,
                                         Pittsburg, Scranton, Harrisburg, Allentown, and Philly.
