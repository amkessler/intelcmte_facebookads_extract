                                         the same labor pool occupied by current unemployed jobseekers. Expressly
                                          because they arrive on legal immigrant visas, most will be able to draw a wide
                                         range of taxpayer-funded benefits, and corporations will be allowed to directly
                                         substitute these workers for Americans.

                                         announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on
                                         October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall. Organizers of the
                                          Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks,
                                          Latinos and incarcerated.
                                         They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
                                         radical groups. Only black activists say ""black lives matter"", forgetting the fact
                                         that justice is when all lives matter.
                                         Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
                                         law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
                                         over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
                                         immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
                                          be imprisoned.
                                         Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
                                         Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's
                                          benevolent intentions.
                                         This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
                                         communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
                                         news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
                                          Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
                                         American extremists to execute him.
                                         There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he
                                         should live here legally; he should not break the law.

                                         today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer
                                         terrorism. Nevertheless, we will not allow terrorists to change our way of life.

                                         The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky clerk's request to
                                         keep enforcing her ""no marriage licenses"" policy — an attempt to avoid
                                         issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
                                         court's preliminary ruling.
                                         Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage
                                         licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
                                         a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled
                                         off to jail.
                                         For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
                                         She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she's
                                         screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!
                                         And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
                                         religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
                                          her role only to enact it!
                                         Funny how all these ""Christians"" are preaching and practicing all this hate,
                                         eh?
                                          If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, ""What the hell

                                         in too many forms. Ok! I just noticed one interesting thing ... The kids that need
                                         foster care come from heterosexual families. So I think the straights should be
                                         banned from being foster parents!
                                         A Kansas Department of Children and Families official said that the state will
                                         continue to allow qualified single adults to serve as foster parents for abused
                                         and neglected children, but she said her agency isn't ready to say whether it
                                         will allow married same-sex couples to do so.
                                         Oh God ... Just because your gay doesn't make you any less of a human or
                                         any less deserving of any right afforded to anyone else! Anyone who believes
                                         that a gay person is below a straight person needs treatment!

                                         Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014

                                         parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The
                                         answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
                                         to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your
                                         continued relationship with your son or daughter.
                                         Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
                                         child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
                                         problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
                                         that time.
                                         Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're
                                         hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you
                                         choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the
                                         impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want
                                         for dinner?"").
                                         Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If
                                         you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you
                                         would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
                                         secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.
                                         It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because
                                         homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
                                         for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
                                         telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".
                                         On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
                                         and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is
                                         she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!
                                         DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!

                                          Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
                                          Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban.
                                         Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
                                         among his fellow Army soldiers.
                                          But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first
                                         openly trans soldier of the US Army.
                                          He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his
                                          muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
                                          he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
                                         gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska.
                                         Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
                                          been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
                                          paperwork, he is identified as a woman.
                                          But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
                                         the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!
                                         America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
                                          Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

                                         After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious
                                         education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she
                                         just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's
                                         been married for all eight years.
                                         Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing
                                         their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is
                                         the biggest mistake!
                                         When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about
                                         homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about
                                         being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and
                                         harassment.
                                         Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for
                                         straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and
                                         people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's
                                         important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be
                                         illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual

                                         always gets better. I would really appreciate this because I want to become

                                         Ever since I was little, I knew I was different. I wasn't like any of the other

                                         wanted to look like them. I wanted to be them. It felt right playing with these
                                         dolls. I had to hide when I did it though because even at an early age, I knew
                                         boys weren't supposed to play with dolls. Once I had gotten got caught by
                                         my grandmother's ex husband and he told me to put them away and stop

                                         While Black activists are trying to strict American government's attention by
                                         organizing protests, Black bank owners urge Black Americans to transfer
                                         money into their banks.
                                         A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the
                                         main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the
                                         request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money
                                         into Black-owned banks in the last 5 days.
                                         50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds
                                         from non-Black banks to Black-owned institutions which would help to
                                         empower and advance Black community.

                                          HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF
                                         The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
                                          had a °medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
                                         from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was
                                         too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.
                                         On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting
                                         that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas,
                                         was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his
                                         son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
                                          hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken
                                         to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his
                                         combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
                                          breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour
                                         later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
                                         An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
                                         inmate.
                                          Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were
                                         followed.
                                         We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after ""fighting"" with
                                         the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at

                                         up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She
                                         became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of
                                         today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child
                                         is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck
                                         for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess
                                         she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced. Black people

                                         Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning. The second coalition
                                         strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it
                                         clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government
                                         agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this
                                         is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development
                                          programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,
                                         Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in
                                         their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.
                                          However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they

(1)0000842.pdf,2461,"""First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank
                                          you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
                                         struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
                                         where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
                                         community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
                                         improve our Chicago...
                                         All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free
                                         concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you
                                         care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
                                         away from artists, but it hasn't changed you...
                                         We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
                                         have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
                                         and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you.
                                          Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
                                         stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent
                                         violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
                                         someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
                                         and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
                                         successful, still be self-made...
                                         Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we
                                         know and love, Chicago.
                                         Sincerely,

                                          It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young
                                          people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
                                         cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
                                          It should work.
                                         As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget
                                         who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love.
                                         That's cool that this love goes back and forth!
                                         We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
                                          people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
                                         different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

(1)0001035.pdf,2790,"HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS
                                         The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was
                                         in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life
                                         improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
                                         some real Clinton decisions:
                                         —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
                                          been exaggerated by Republicans.
                                         —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
                                         supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'
                                          medical care.
                                         -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20
                                          million for veterans' health care facilities.
                                         -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion
                                         for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.""
                                         In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
                                          poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
                                         issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
                                         need so bad!
                                          Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
                                         direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one
                                         raises these concerns.

                                         AP classes which led me to create a goal to continue onto higher education.
                                         Formal education allowed me to begin a career but most importantly it
                                         allowed me to figure out a special side of me. I am so blessed and humbled to

                                          police shooting of Philando Castile resulted in the arrest of 46 people outside
                                         the governor's mansion in St. Paul, Minnesota. Another arrest was carried
                                         out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protestors were
                                         arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July
                                         7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have
                                          been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police
                                         officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are
                                          blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the
                                          protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors
                                         are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.
                                         Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters
                                         have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

                                         only do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the
                                          highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a
                                         video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire
                                         and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he
                                         commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately
                                         ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position
                                         when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him
                                         and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is
                                         there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

                                         spirit — a symbol of hope that he watches over them.
                                         She also did this as a memorial for her unborn daughter who is due March 25.
                                         We commend her for her boldness and we hope that she finds solace in these

                                         often been problematic, counterproductive, and just fucking weird since their
                                         inception.
                                         Take, for instance, the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society of 1833, which
                                          believed that slave owners were missing out on a business opportunity by not
                                          putting slaves on the payroll.

                                          him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or
                                         violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.

                                         in 2014. Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen
                                         named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to
                                         assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in
                                          Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by

                                         stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the
                                         children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers — ages of 5, 9,
                                         and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old
                                          boy. This outrageous act led to his sentence of 40 years imprisonment and a

                                         failed to settle a fine. Most people are jailed because one way or the other
                                         there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even
                                         though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a
                                         gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put
                                          behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life
                                          becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making
                                         a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all

(1)0001505.pdf,834,"A lone sniper shot 14 people and killed 5 police officers, in Dallas late
                                         Thursday night. It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton
                                         Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights,
                                          Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of chaos and
                                         carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. The
                                         sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war.
                                         As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to ""kill white people"".
                                         There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no
                                          proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago
                                         and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah
                                         X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us
                                         time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers».
                                         The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is
                                         a violent anti-government riot!

                                         only do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the
                                          highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a
                                         video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire
                                         and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he
                                         commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately
                                         ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position
                                         when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him
                                         and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is
                                         there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

                                         fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This
                                         is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without
                                          prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black
                                          person's life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the
                                         second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired.
                                          It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led
                                         to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

                                         gay club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even
                                         if it's evident. There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or
                                         just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But
                                         if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
                                         secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
                                         cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
                                          misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
                                         withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
                                         administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
                                         enough,""Sworn officer of the court"" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is
                                         even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
                                         of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

                                          present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we
                                         refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to
                                          benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason.
                                          He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is
                                         the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.
                                         The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black
                                         community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by
                                         day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In

                                          Of course, the highest incarceration level is among the black population of the
                                         country. The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the
                                         whole community. Kids have to grow up not knowing their fathers and not

                                          pipeline doesn't leave them much of a choice. The kids grow up in extreme
                                          poverty without the access to the basic things like healthcare or education.
                                         The system is build to keep as many black people in the jails as possible.

                                   On April 14 the Plummers' door had been kicked in by burglars.
                                   On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see
                                   the police lights because the unit was parked down the road.
                                   Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his
                                   Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.
                                   When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend
                                   off the would-be burglars.
                                   However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

                                   American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. The goal was to ""disrupt
                                   the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Well, the
                                   intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida — even after its
                                   leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos — has spawned cells
                                   elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is
                                   rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question
                                   is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the
                                   mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should

                                   A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper
                                   spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday.
                                   Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they
                                   caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
                                   commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent
                                   debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
                                   nose and throat.
                                   The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
                                   an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
                                   body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
                                   investigation.
                                   This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
                                   death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
                                   dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,
                                   but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this
                                   acceptable?
                                   We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over.

                                   People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the
                                   North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
                                   trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was

                                   to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her children would get arrested.
                                   What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,
                                   improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.

                                   A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for
                                   decades. But about four years ago; he was taking care of his wife, who had
                                   Alzheimer's disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the
                                   process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling
                                   $73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan

                                   For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor charges in
                                   New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'cause they
                                   couldn't afford to pay bail.
                                   Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
                                   week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
                                   system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
                                   the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
                                   disorderly conduct.
                                   The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
                                   with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
                                   should we do?
                                   The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it
                                   is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
                                   people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
                                   business.
                                   The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
                                   will start to sell indulgences soon.
                                   Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
                                   solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
                                   potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

                                   A police officer in Alabama proposed murdering a black resident and creating
                                   bogus evidence to suggest the killing was in self-defense.
                                   Officer Troy Middlebrooks kept his job and continues to patrol Alexander City
                                   after authorities there paid the man $35,000 to avoid being publicly sued over
                                   the incident. Middlebrooks, a veteran of the US marines, said the man ""needs
                                   a god damn bullet"" and allegedly referred to him as ""that nigger"", after
                                   becoming frustrated that the man was not punished more harshly over a prior
                                   run-in.
                                   The payment was made to the black resident, Vincent Bias, after a secret
                                   recording of Middlebrooks's remarks was played to the city's police chiefs
                                   and the mayor. Elected city councillors said they were not consulted.

                                   An unarmed black teenager in Texas was shot dead by a cop who had only
                                   recently graduated from the police academy. Just over a week before his
                                   death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter.
                                   Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 a.m. on Friday, hearing reports
                                   that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the
                                   lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the
                                   dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom,
                                   Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when
                                   told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer
                                   Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation
                                   broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of
                                   Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.
                                   And now there are three main points that you should think of:
                                   1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo
                                   State University. Never was involved in criminal activities.
                                   2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and
                                   was working under the supervision of a training officer.
                                   3) Taylor didn't want to die young.
                                   Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one
                                   to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want

                                   During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
                                   against him at the Green Line's Lexington Parkway Station.
                                   The teen suffers from Asperger's syndrome, which causes him to strongly
                                   dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
                                   legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.
                                   Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify

                                   Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really
                                   understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong.
                                   Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions

                                   manslaughter and two lesser charges in her death, but the case was dropped
                                   in January 2015.

                                   20 years ago. 20 years a million men, women and children gathered on the
                                   National Mall in Washington, DC answering the call from Minister Louis
                                   Farrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers
                                   and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years
                                   later, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice
                                   system once and for all.
                                   I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than
                                   there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local

                                   an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that
                                   disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white
                                   people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry
                                   off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't
                                   video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that
                                   criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before
                                   they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on
                                   incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a
                                   system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.
                                   To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school

                                   Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
                                   small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
                                   classrooms in Snyder Hall.
                                   Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
                                   responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
                                   handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
                                   fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.
                                   One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's
                                   religions before he began firing.
                                   The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
                                   and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had
                                   volunteered to help.
                                   It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
                                   the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
                                   months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some
                                   gun control yet?
                                   Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
                                   BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
                                   dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
                                   few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's
                                   white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it

                                   A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black
                                   church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved
                                   shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
                                   Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
                                   investigated as hate crime.
                                   Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was
                                   found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.
                                   Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most
                                   common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
                                   xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
                                   that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
                                   take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
                                   think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
                                   Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
                                   February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
                                   the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
                                   and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes?
                                   What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it
                                   racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
                                   deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore?

                                   the children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and
                                   the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon

                                   The confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery
                                   time, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask
                                   to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel
                                   African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.
                                   Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of
                                   America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations.
                                   We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist
                                   political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to

                                   slaves on their farms.
                                   How can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show

                                   it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy.""
                                   ""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and
                                   intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and
                                   fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said
                                   we have to fight against racism, what were we told?'No, he can't deal with
                                   racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president
                                   of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America
                                   but white supremacy is American as cherry pie.""
                                   West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and
                                   2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he
                                   knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big
                                   corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks
                                   from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just
                                   count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The

                                   The Baltimore state medical examiner's office has found that Freddie Gray
                                   likely died from a single ""high-energy injury"" sustained as he rode shackled in
                                   the back of a police van on the day of his arrest, according to an autopsy
                                   report obtained by the Baltimore Sun.
                                   The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up
                                   during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown
                                   against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When
                                   police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a
                                   severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so.

                                   Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and
                                   down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other

                                   both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the chest.

                                   A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black
                                   church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved
                                   shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
                                   Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
                                   investigated as hate crime.
                                   Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was
                                   found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.
                                   Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most
                                   common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
                                   xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
                                   that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
                                   take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
                                   think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
                                   Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
                                   February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
                                   the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
                                   and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes?
                                   What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it
                                   racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a

                                   percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory.
                                   Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the
                                   Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
                                   term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
                                   dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.
                                   Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
                                   obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
                                   never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
                                   2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
                                   the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.
                                   But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a
                                   subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
                                   treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
                                   the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
                                   presidential veto.
                                   The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
                                   overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
                                   instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
                                   senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
                                   more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
                                   support the deal.
                                   Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
                                   simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
                                   and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
                                   percent.
                                   Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care

                                   themselves.
                                   This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
                                   too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be

                                   States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama
                                   became the President. The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org
                                   states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
                                   office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
                                   New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
                                   (21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).
                                   Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
                                   fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
                                   Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
                                   too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
                                   new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
                                   terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened.
                                   We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from
                                   the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism,

(1)0002277.pdf,442,"The threat of possible ISIS attacks on the U.S. Military families has risen
                                   U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado said in a statement
                                   that he was alarmed by the reports of an FBI alert that relatives of the US
                                   military personnel in Wyoming and Colorado were harassed outside their
                                   homes by Middle Eastern men and might have been under surveillance. A
                                   copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached
                                   in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May.
                                   Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June.
                                   We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military
                                   has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are
                                   doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties.
                                   First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to
                                   identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military.
                                   Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special
                                   protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family
                                   members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a
                                   dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a
                                   negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the
                                   final nail in the coffin of the American secret services.
                                   Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the
                                   Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the

                                   First, the 2nd amendment makes people less prone to crimes. Most of people
                                   will not attack others, if they have a chance to be shot. Moreover, armed

                                   U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973. The government spent
                                   more than $120 billion on the conflict in Vietnam from 1965-73 that led to the
                                   widespread inflation. Psychological effects were even deeper. The war had
                                   pierced the myth of American invincibility, and had bitterly divided the nation.
                                   Many returning veterans faced negative reactions from both opponents of the
                                   war and its supporters.

                                   which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The
                                   figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the
                                   total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would
                                   actually be larger than 1.24 million.
                                   Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had
                                   huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today
                                   there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is
                                   a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate
                                   fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low
                                   wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy.
                                   Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state
                                   budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions
                                   increases crime rates.
                                   Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of
                                   people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a
                                   report of the Center for Immigration Studies.
                                   You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates
                                   social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen
                                   the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of

                                   It's respect to American history. The Founding Fathers were very smart
                                   people. And it may be assumed they were smarter than many liberals.
                                   The second amendment is deterrent. If a criminal knows you have a gun, he
                                   doesn't want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but
                                   criminals don't know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase
                                   crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly
                                   state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate.
                                   The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as
                                   usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in

                                   14 years ago America has changed forever. One of the darkest days in
                                   American history came. The tragedy of September 11th is still touching us.
                                   Some of us lost our family members or our friends, while others saw the

                                   the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11?
                                   I'd like to tell you #My911 Story.
                                   I was only 15 when the attacks occurred. I was at school. I remember that
                                   somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC.
                                   We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few
                                   minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom
                                   called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I
                                   remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took
                                   responsibility for the attacks.
                                   And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11?

                                   ""white supremacists"". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist

                                   nobility"". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying ""It is
                                   almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
                                   He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
                                   historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
                                   was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
                                   advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the

                                   out the task.

                                   Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request

                                   Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish.

                                   A lot of transgendered women don't have support systems or employment.

                                   fueled by transphobia and we do know that Amber's murder is the 12th

                                   CHANGE 'F' TO 'M' ON DRIVER'S LICENSE.
                                   One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been
                                   discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.
                                   There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change
                                   the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.
                                   But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
                                   reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
                                   people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.
                                   It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her
                                   identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed
                                   as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
                                   about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
                                   or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
                                   were assigned to at birth.
                                   Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
                                   changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
                                   Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
                                   were assigned to at birth.

                                   The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo.
                                   with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a

                                   for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a
                                   torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted
                                   system is against her.
                                   It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must
                                   be ""broken"" or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she
                                   exposed the government's crimes, and government really doesn't like it, and
                                   second, because she's trans.
                                   Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's clear
                                   who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint
                                   Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic character.
                                   But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych
                                   ward?
                                   Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning
                                   forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had
                                   been through enough already!

                                   and illustrated by Jason Badower.
                                   Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story -
                                   specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.
                                   ""I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of
                                   the most recognizable, iconic characters in the world to be among the first to
                                   step forward and officially endorse this new law,"" he said. ""I thought, let's not
                                   just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.""
                                   Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as
                                   supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark
                                   milestone in LBGTQ rights history.
                                   Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to
                                   change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her

                                   smash hit sci-fi franchise with arch-baddie Darth Vader.
                                   The space warrior appears in Star Wars: Aftermath, which bridges the gap
                                   between Return of the Jedi and new film The Force Awakens.
                                   Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker's Rebellion, is
                                   the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his
                                   sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to chat him up.
                                   Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: ""I don't think his

                                   Passing the ""First Amendment Defense Act"" introduced by Sen. Mike Lee
                                   has been anti-LGBT conservatives' top priority since the Supreme Court
                                   brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It's part of the National
                                   Organization for Marriage's post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential
                                   candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily.
                                   Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does
                                   is enable anti-gay discrimination.
                                   Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against
                                   religious institutions —for discriminating against people in same-sex
                                   marriages. It's the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government
                                   never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
                                   couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

                                   orientation. In Oregon,judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by
                                   Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing

                                   they're thus the real victims.
                                   There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having
                                   a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do

                                   most influential LGBT roles throughout his acting career.
                                   The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by
                                   suicide on August 11 2014.
                                   His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: ""As he is
                                   remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the
                                   countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.""
                                   Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with
                                   his trademark playfulness.
                                   While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about
                                   discussing the sexuality of his pet pug.
                                   He said: ""I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend
                                   and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We're very

                                   National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
                                   candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let's take a look at just how crazy
                                   this pledge gets.
                                   That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
                                   amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
                                   decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
                                   percent!
                                   But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn
                                   any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
                                   the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
                                   this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
                                   supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge.
                                   Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating
                                   loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious
                                   justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
                                   so it's a huge concern.
                                   And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
                                   against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
                                   harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
                                   from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it!
                                   There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they
                                   finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
                                   face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
                                   worked for made anyone's life better. At all.
                                   They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
                                   And when they're dead and gone, they'll be remembered only as footnotes
                                   in shameful history — or more likely they'll be forgotten completely.

                                   Obama's policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
                                   ""We're not going into Syria"", Trump said it to calm down those who got really
                                   concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war.
                                   really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
                                   politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.
                                   Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense
                                   Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
                                   deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
                                   Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
                                   his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
                                   is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
                                   puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will

                                   Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly
                                   opposite to the ""America First"" concept.
                                   I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and

                                   today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis

                                   before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the
                                   second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face.
                                   The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
                                   him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have
                                   anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
                                   incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and
                                   claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
                                   arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame.
                                   This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
                                   enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
                                   is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they
                                   admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY: TWO

                                   North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
                                   old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
                                   drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
                                   shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
                                   defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
                                   hitting Scott five times from behind.
                                   Slager's defense attorney's:
                                   ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically
                                   motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
                                   their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split-
                                   second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable
                                   armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.'
                                   The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
                                   brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's
                                   dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
                                   about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
                                   jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
                                   bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.

                                   approached a group of police officers in her car.
                                   Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
                                   warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
                                   who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
                                   When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
                                   her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

(1)0002901.pdf,1107,"On October 15, 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP.
                                   Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take
                                   action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge
                                   police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
                                   government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
                                   ""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close
                                   it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
                                   dissolved.
                                   50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
                                   stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country
                                   like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
                                   need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
                                   can make Black Lives really matter.
                                   Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has
                                   made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their

                                   After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's
                                   hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
                                   April 2014.
                                   The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
                                   braids and twists amidst the criticism.
                                   Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight.
                                   Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
                                   caused a lot of unnecessary stress.
                                   The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
                                   January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
                                   Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half-
                                   inch wide.
                                   Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have

                                   crafted to empower Black communities economically. The plan contained
                                   basic demands such as self-determination, decent housing, full employment,
                                   education that included African-American history, and an end to police
                                   brutality. The list of confirmed speakers will be released a few days before the
                                   event.

                                   According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever
                                   since they returned to work; they have been subjected to petty attacks and
                                   denied attempts in promotion.

                                   and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall,. police

                                   and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.
                                   The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
                                   Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
                                   something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
                                   We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
                                   united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
                                   Douglas said "" Power concedes nothing except by a demand"". Our demand
                                   of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the

                                   Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted
                                   about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police
                                   officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses; he was so mad about
                                   the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.
                                   Abdulwalia's anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some
                                   apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should

                                   refugees from Syria and Iraq to come to the US as the fallout from last
                                   Friday's Isis terrorist attacks in Paris continues.
                                   In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no
                                   longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too
                                   great a risk to national security.
                                   New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie
                                   has said his state will not take in any refugees — ""not even orphans under the
                                   age of five"".
                                   Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to
                                   ""track"" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have
                                   played down.
                                   GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US
                                   government prioritize Christian refugees.
                                   Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the
                                   anti-refugee comments as ""un-American"", but experts worry the backlash
                                   could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked.

                                   happened the night a Chicago.
                                   The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez,
                                   brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when Morsi-
                                   Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and
                                   demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license;
                                   Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor
                                   Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only
                                   victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.
                                   The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why
                                   the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held
                                   personally and financially responsible for their actions.
                                   Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards civilians in a combat
                                   zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another

                                   Recently released video shows the moment officers shot 24-year-old Brandon
                                   Bethea with a stun gun as he was in a jail cell.
                                   Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with
                                   a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.
                                   FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the
                                   trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the
                                   officers involved in Bethea's death.
                                   There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20
                                   minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they
                                   attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in

                                   Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
                                   realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
                                   is priceless.
                                   The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
                                   illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
                                   had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
                                   driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
                                   threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.
                                   The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
                                   years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
                                   how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
                                   the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
                                   is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
                                   have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.
                                   To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
                                   Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
                                   our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

                                   ?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
                                   a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
                                   altercation with a student.
                                   According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
                                   Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.
                                   The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
                                   brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.
                                   I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
                                   then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
                                   happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
                                   officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide

                                   about police brutality against black women?
                                   I wonder, why is no one talking about black women abused by police? At the
                                   time when Americans' attention focuses primarily on the relationship between
                                   black men and law enforcement, we've got to admit the fact that Black women
                                   have a tough time too.
                                   To my mind it should come to national spotlight; from teen girl, who was
                                   slammed to the floor in a South Carolina classroom to the mysterious death of
                                   Sandra Bland in a jail cell. We want to give you a chance to express yourself

                                   take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
                                   judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,
                                   it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
                                   someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
                                   eyes.
                                   It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
                                   difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
                                   get away with it.
                                   In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
                                   that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
                                   they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

                                   it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
                                   someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
                                   eyes.
                                   It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
                                   difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
                                   get away with it.
                                   In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
                                   that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
                                   they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

                                   who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in
                                   what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.
                                   Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which
                                   occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St.
                                   That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.
                                   One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
                                   a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous.
                                   They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they
                                   noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
                                   money.
                                   When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
                                   for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.
                                   The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
                                   motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who
                                   had gotten out of the car.
                                   The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this
                                   country,""
                                   According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country.
                                   Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?""
                                   The incident ""escalated really quick,"" with the suspect attempting to punch
                                   his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
                                   he was assaulted and knocked down.
                                   He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around
                                   the two students, chanting ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" and screaming, ""We'll

                                   We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the
                                   rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
                                   voices be heard.
                                   We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
                                   campaign, but did you support us before campaign?
                                   We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
                                   Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
                                   hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
                                   homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
                                   and children, to die in their homes, and for what?
                                   Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI-
                                   Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
                                   forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
                                   and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
                                   and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
                                   CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
                                   also injured in the attacks.
                                   You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
                                   countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
                                   not only to the U.S. but the whole world!
                                   You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the
                                   same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
                                   creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
                                   Afghanistan and Syria.
                                   8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
                                   ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change

                                   The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years, Ali was
                                   renowned as a larger than life figure, the greatest, as he called himself, and
                                   the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be

                                   In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing
                                   legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular
                                   culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came
                                   to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things
                                   unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.
                                   He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.
                                   Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was
                                   accused of committing a felony.
                                   Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot
                                   be filled.

                                   Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over
                                   the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,
                                   eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5

                                   most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as
                                   unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as
                                   they can.

                                   officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get

                                   12-year-old was carrying a toy airsoft gun when officer Timothy Loehmann
                                   shot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not
                                   indict the killer.
                                   Tamir's mother said she is ""mad as hell"" with the grand jury's decision of
                                   declaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say,""He was my bright and
                                   shining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to
                                   become anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn't

                                   White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.

                                   year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
                                   One of co-founders said ""We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit
                                   is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support.""

                                   spear symbolizes ""whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
                                   people.""
                                   The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
                                   Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice.
                                   This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
                                   Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
                                   spaces""for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital

                                   between African-Americans and Caucasians.
                                   The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
                                   likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between
                                   $65,000 and $75,000 per year.
                                   Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
                                   Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-
                                   Americans.

                                   Apparently, the man's main goal was to destroy the portrait of former Texas
                                   Governor Fletcher Stockdale. The man was arrested right in the Capitol and
                                   charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.
                                   It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards
                                   Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.
                                   Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda
                                   influences even on Southern people.
                                   The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be
                                   blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American
                                   history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect.
                                   It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect

                                   On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
                                   Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
                                   The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
                                   down her window ""all the way"" to receive her ticket. When King refused,
                                   which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
                                   the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her,
                                   the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
                                   When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police

                                   the most political courage"". He said that sending troops to Syria was a very
                                   difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama
                                   was hated for not taking actions, but it's better for being hated for not killing
                                   innocent people that for starting a useless war.
                                   Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that
                                   would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed.
                                   Unfortunately, the recent government didn't think twice, before they started
                                   bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill

                                   Black people from participating in such sports, back in the days.
                                   But thanks to Debi Thomas and other Black skaters; we changed the game
                                   and on Feb. 8. 1986. Debi became the first Black skater to hold a US national
                                   titles in ladies' single figure scating.
                                   Debi; a physician, became the 1986 World champion, the 1988 Olympic
                                   bronze medalist; and a two-time U.S. national champion.

                                   before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
                                   sons.
                                   Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
                                   his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
                                   Indianapolis at the age of 26.
                                   Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
                                   authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
                                   duty firefighter.
                                   The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
                                   Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.
                                   Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
                                   sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
                                   off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
                                   their cars.
                                   At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
                                   gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.
                                   She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started
                                   shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
                                   gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
                                   legally owned the gun and did not fire it.
                                   Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
                                   shooting him.
                                   ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley.
                                   Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-
                                   old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.
                                   ""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
                                   have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley.
                                   Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
                                   say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
                                   death, armed or unarmed.

                                   downtown Charleston.
                                   Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
                                   Street that's being displaced by development says he's doing it to make a
                                   statement.
                                   ""It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
                                   that's not done here by black folk. said Joseph Wicks; who now owns the
                                   house at 33 Woolfe St. `None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
                                   toward black folk.""
                                   Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
                                   because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
                                   home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.
                                   The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
                                   cant be torn down!

                                   woman tell Lim,""Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything."" And
                                   why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

                                   Black Americans, the question is ""who will keep his dream alive""?
                                   He saw the promise-land where blacks and whites live together in harmony
                                   and each of them given equal rights and privileges, freedom and justice.
                                   Today, we do not see this equality among blacks and whites in America.
                                   These rights and privileges, freedom and justice shouldn't be for some

                                   The founder and editor-in-chief of Black Millennial and one of the organizers
                                   of Black Lives Matter NYC Arielle Newton is 23-years-old. She is black
                                   college-educated woman who is drawing in $160,000 student loan debt.
                                   Today, Arielle is centered on the roots causes racism and resulting epidemic
                                   discrimination and socioeconomic illness. In fact, in her opinion the
                                   candidates for the next president of the United States of America are
                                   problematic in terms of lack of transparency and accountability. For instance,
                                   one candidate is complicit in fueling the war on drugs; another one in
                                   corrupted criminal justice system, next one in making racial justice as the
                                   centerpiece of the campaign as a strategy to have more black voters.
                                   Doubtless, voting won't bring us safety and won't provide us an immediate
                                   conduit for our social well-being. Ironically, even the first black president of
                                   the United States of America was not able to withstand the racist opposition
                                   and law enforcement. It means voting again for anti-black system won't save

                                   it is becoming dangerous.
                                   So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the
                                   Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the
                                   family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their
                                   own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the
                                   driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.
                                   ""He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a
                                   gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,""
                                   Mark Wilson said.
                                   When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is
                                   beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery
                                   was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that
                                   slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a
                                   flag of England or France.
                                   Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and
                                   monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at
                                   Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
                                   demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
                                   correctness because George Washington owned slaves.
                                   Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans
                                   should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If
                                   somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to
                                   eliminate the party.

                                   Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
                                   Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!
                                   This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
                                   unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
                                   woman tell Lim,""Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything."" And
                                   why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?
                                   Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded
                                   that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be

                                   people were treated disrespectfully! We don't believe apologies, especially

(1)0006536.pdf,2789,"HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS
                                   The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was
                                   in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life
                                   improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
                                   some real Clinton decisions:
                                   —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
                                   been exaggerated by Republicans.
                                   —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
                                   supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'
                                   medical care.
                                   -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20
                                   million for veterans' health care facilities.
                                   -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion
                                   for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.""
                                   In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
                                   poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
                                   issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
                                   need so bad!
