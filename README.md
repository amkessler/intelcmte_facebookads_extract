# intelcmte_facebookads_extract
Extract text from pdf documents containing facebook ad info and build structured database

## Getting the raw documents
A sample of the documents are included in the `pdfs` directory. The entire collection of 3,000+ pdf files is available at https://intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/social-media-advertisements.htm

For those interested in running the extraction code on the entire collection, simply place all of the files found at the link above into the `pdfs` directory on your local machine. For size considerations of this repo on github, only the sample of about 100 files are included here.
