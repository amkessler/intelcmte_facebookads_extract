                                          because they arrive on legal immigrant visas, most will be able to draw a wide
                                         range of taxpayer-funded benefits, and corporations will be allowed to directly

                                         They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
                                         radical groups. Only black activists say ""black lives matter"", forgetting the fact
                                         that justice is when all lives matter.
                                         Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
                                         law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
                                         over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
                                         immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
                                          be imprisoned.
                                         Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
                                         Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's

                                         This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim

                                         This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
                                         communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
                                         news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
                                          Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
                                         American extremists to execute him.
                                         There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he
                                         should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice.

                                          Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal tells Newsmax TV.

                                         things and continue to let illegals into the US. They want to keep the border

                                         gaining entry.
                                         ""I saw three groups come right across in broad daylight,"" he said. ""One group

                                          What's also confusing in that poll — almost every fifth polled soldier refuses to

                                         The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky clerk's request to
                                         keep enforcing her ""no marriage licenses"" policy — an attempt to avoid
                                         issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
                                         court's preliminary ruling.
                                         Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage
                                         licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
                                         a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled
                                         off to jail.
                                         For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
                                         She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she's
                                         screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!
                                         And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
                                         religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
                                          her role only to enact it!
                                         Funny how all these ""Christians"" are preaching and practicing all this hate,
                                         eh?
                                          If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, ""What the hell
                                         is wrong with you people!""

                                         organization.
                                         This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders
                                         without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting's longstanding
                                         policy of chartered organizations selecting their leaders.
                                         The Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay adults has stood as a towering
                                         example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America's most
                                         important and recognizable civic organizations.
                                         This is a step in the right direction , but we're still really concerned that there
                                         are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay leaders ... This

./pdfs/P(1)0000158.pdf,634,"Most parents aren't prepared for the words, ""Mom, Dad. I'm gay."" For many
                                         parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The
                                         answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
                                         to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your
                                         continued relationship with your son or daughter.
                                         Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
                                         child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
                                         problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
                                         that time.
                                         Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're
                                         hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you
                                         choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the
                                         impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want
                                         for dinner?"").
                                         Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If
                                         you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you
                                         would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
                                         secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.
                                         It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because
                                         homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
                                         for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
                                         telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".
                                         On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
                                         and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is
                                         she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!

                                          Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
                                          Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban.
                                         Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
                                         among his fellow Army soldiers.
                                          But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first
                                         openly trans soldier of the US Army.
                                          He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his
                                          muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
                                          he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
                                         gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska.
                                         Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
                                          been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
                                          paperwork, he is identified as a woman.
                                          But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
                                         the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!
                                         America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
                                          Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

                                         After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious
                                         education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she
                                         just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's
                                         been married for all eight years.
                                         Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing
                                         their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is
                                         the biggest mistake!
                                         When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about
                                         homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about
                                         being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and
                                         harassment.
                                         Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for
                                         straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and
                                         people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's
                                         important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be
                                         illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual

                                         break from the hospital to get some food. When they returned, they had a
                                         flurry of phone messages from the mother, crying and urging them to get back
                                         soon. A nurse had been questioning her about her decision to let a gay
                                         couple adopt her baby.
                                         ""Aren't you afraid those boys are gonna hurt that baby? Aren't you afraid
                                         that he's not gonna grow up and be normal?"" asked the nurse.
                                         Excuse me who the hell is she?! This bigot is forcing her views onto the
                                         mother, because she doesn't think the baby would grow up ""normal""? A
                                         mother who's making the difficult decision to place her son up for adoption,
                                         and a wonderful couple who wants to raise that child. What the hell right does
                                         the nurse have to try to stop that? I hope they fire her.

                                         timely message for today.
                                         The two recent U.S. wars were costly for our nation; to put it lightly. They led
                                         to domestic devastation of country. No matter what Defense Secretary or
                                         POTUS are saying they don't fool me with promises of gay military equality as
                                          key to the nation's agenda. Better talk to me about cutting DoD's budget.

                                         While Black activists are trying to strict American government's attention by
                                         organizing protests, Black bank owners urge Black Americans to transfer
                                         money into their banks.
                                         A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the
                                         main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the
                                         request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money
                                         into Black-owned banks in the last 5 days.
                                         50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds
                                         from non-Black banks to Black-owned institutions which would help to
                                         empower and advance Black community.

                                          HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF
                                         The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
                                          had a °medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
                                         from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was
                                         too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.
                                         On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting
                                         that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas,
                                         was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his
                                         son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
                                          hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken
                                         to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his
                                         combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
                                          breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour
                                         later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
                                         An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
                                         inmate.
                                          Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were
                                         followed.
                                         We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after ""fighting"" with
                                         the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
                                          hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
