                                          because they arrive on legal immigrant visas, most will be able to draw a wide
                                         range of taxpayer-funded benefits, and corporations will be allowed to directly

                                         They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
                                         radical groups. Only black activists say ""black lives matter"", forgetting the fact
                                         that justice is when all lives matter.
                                         Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
                                         law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
                                         over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
                                         immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
                                          be imprisoned.
                                         Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
                                         Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's

                                         This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim

                                         This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
                                         communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
                                         news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
                                          Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
                                         American extremists to execute him.
                                         There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he
                                         should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice.
